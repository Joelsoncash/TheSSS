# Trading Project

This project implements a trading application that utilizes a `Trade` class to manage trading operations and integrates a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to execute trades based on market data.

## Project Structure

- `trade.py`: Contains the `Trade` class and logic for initializing trading strategies and RL agents.
- `Dockerfile`: Instructions to containerize the application.
- `.dockerignore`: Specifies files and directories to ignore when building the Docker image.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd trading_project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   You can run the application directly using:
   ```
   python trade.py
   ```

## Dockerization

To build and run the Docker container, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```
   docker build -t trading_project .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker container:**
   ```
   docker run trading_project
   ```

## Usage

The application connects to the MT5 trading platform, retrieves market data, and executes trades based on the defined strategy and RL agent. Adjust the parameters in `trade.py` as needed to customize the trading behavior.
